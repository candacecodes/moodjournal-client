## Motivation

We are living in a society with a lot of stress and distractions, sometimes we are unaware of our emotions that could possibly create some negative effects to our mental health. As mental health becomes a widely and openly discussed topic in our current society, we created this mood journal to enable users to record their moods and keep track of them.
